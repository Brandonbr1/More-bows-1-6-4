# More Bows 1.6.4

This is a simple port to 1.6.4 of iDiamondhunter's More bows mod. It was only updated to 1.6.2, and there was no 1.6.4 build of this published; meaning there was this annoying gap where it just would not work with 1.6.4, where the majority of 1.6 mods are.
This is a simple port which adds it to 1.6.4.

Almost 99% of the code is to iDiamondhunter. All I did was change a few things to make it work.
